# Refactoring for Accessibility
I refactored the html and css of this web application with the primary goal of making it more accessible. 

# Motivation
For this project, I wanted to familiarize myself with best-practices for both accessibility and code refactoring. 

# Credits
The project was based on code supplied by the UNC-Chapel Hill coding bootcamp.
